## Potential Threats and Mitigations

### 1. SQL Injection
**Risk Level**: Critical
**Description**: Attackers might attempt to inject malicious SQL code through user inputs.
**Mitigation**:
- Use parameterized queries for all database operations
- Implement ORM with proper escaping
- Input validation and sanitization
- Least privilege database user accounts

### 2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
**Risk Level**: High
**Description**: Attackers might inject client-side scripts into pages viewed by other users.
**Mitigation**:
- Content Security Policy implementation
- Input sanitization
- Output encoding
- Use React's built-in XSS protection
- Avoid `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`

### 3. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
**Risk Level**: Medium
**Description**: Attackers might trick users into performing unwanted actions while authenticated.
**Mitigation**:
- Anti-CSRF tokens with each state-changing request
- SameSite cookie attributes
- Verify Origin and Referer headers
- Require confirmation for sensitive actions

### 4. Broken Authentication
**Risk Level**: Critical
**Description**: Vulnerabilities in the authentication system could allow unauthorized access.
**Mitigation**:
- JWT with proper signature validation
- Short token expiration times
- Secure cookie storage
- Multi-factor authentication
- Rate limiting on login attempts
- Strong password policies

### 5. Security Misconfiguration
**Risk Level**: High
**Description**: Improper configuration of the application, framework, or server.
**Mitigation**:
- Security headers (X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
- HTTPS enforcement
- Secure cookie attributes
- Proper error handling without exposing details
- Regular security audits

### 6. Sensitive Data Exposure
**Risk Level**: Critical
**Description**: Exposure of sensitive data due to weak encryption or improper handling.
**Mitigation**:
- Encryption of sensitive data at rest
- HTTPS for data in transit
- Proper key management
- Data minimization (only store what's necessary)
- Redaction of sensitive information in logs

## Risk Assessment Matrix

| Threat | Likelihood (1-10) | Impact (1-10) | Risk Score | Status |
|--------|-------------------|---------------|------------|--------|
| SQL Injection | 7 | 9 | 63 | Mitigated |
| XSS | 8 | 7 | 56 | Mitigated |
| CSRF | 6 | 6 | 36 | Mitigated |
| Broken Authentication | 7 | 9 | 63 | Mitigated |
| Security Misconfiguration | 8 | 7 | 56 | Mitigated |
| Sensitive Data Exposure | 6 | 9 | 54 | Mitigated |

## Mitigation Strategy Implementation

The SecuritySentinel application implements these mitigations through:

1. **Input Validation Layer**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
2. **Authentication System**: Secure JWT implementation with proper validation
3. **Security Headers**: Comprehensive set of security headers
4. **Content Security Policy**: Strict CSP implementation
5. **Database Security**: Parameterized queries and least privilege principle
6. **Error Handling**: Custom error handling without exposing system details
7. **Monitoring**: Real-time security monitoring and alerting system

## Regular Security Review Process

The security posture is regularly reviewed through:
1. Automated security scanning
2. Manual code reviews
3. Penetration testing
4. Vulnerability assessments
5. Security log analysis
